[**Declare variable types in TypeScript guided exercise, using Typescript**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/typescript-declare-variable-types/8-types-lab)
```typescript
/* Module 2: Declare variable types in TypeScript
   Lab start  */

/*  EXERCISE 1
    TODO: Modify the code to add types to the variable declarations. 
    The resulting JavaScript should look the same as the original example when you're done. */

let firstName: string;
let lastName: string;
let fullName: string;
let age: number;

} else {
    console.log("My name is " + fullName + ", I'm " + age + ", and I'm not a citizen of the United Kingdom.");
}

/* EXERCISE 2
   TODO: You can use types to ensure operation outcomes. Run the code as is and then modify 
   it to have strongly typed variables. Then, address any errors you find so that the result 
   returned to a is 12. */

    } else if(typeof x === 'string' && typeof y === 'string'){
        return x.concat(y);
    }
}
console.log(add(5,7));

/* EXERCISE 3
   TODO: In the following code, implement an enum type called Season that represents 
   the constants "Fall", "Winter", "Spring", and "Summer". Then, update the function so 
   you can pass in the season by referencing an item in the enum, for example 
   Season.Fall, instead of the literal string "Fall". */

/* EXERCISE 4
   TODO: Declare the array as the type to match the type of the items in the array. */

   let randomNumbers: number[]=[];
   let nextNumber;
   
   for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

[**TypeScript Object Type exercise**](https://typescript-exercises.github.io/#exercise=1)
```typescript
/*
Intro:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
    This would be the base for our future experiments during
    these exercises.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

*/

export interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
};

export const users: User[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: User) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

console.log('Users:');
users.forEach(logPerson);
```
[**TypeScript Unions exercise**](https://typescript-exercises.github.io/#exercise=2)
```typescript
/*

Intro:

    All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go
    forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.
    Let's add a couple of admins.

    Initially we only had users in the in-memory database. After
    introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that
    everything works well together.

Exercise:

    Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use
    it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix
    all the TS errors.

*/

interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

interface Admin {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    role: string;
}

export type Person = User | Admin;

export const persons: Person[] /* <- Person[] */ = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Jane Doe',
        age: 32,
        role: 'Administrator'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    },
    {
        name: 'Bruce Willis',
        age: 64,
        role: 'World saver'
    }
