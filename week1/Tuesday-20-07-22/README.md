**create an explanation about Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages**

Interpreted languages run the program line by line, like a live translation for the computer. This process makes execution slower
Compiled languages convert the program directly to machine code, in binary. This process makes execution faster since the computer just have to read the already translated code.

**Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?**
Java is both compiled and interpreted, it first compiles to bytecode, then the Java Virtual Machine interprets the bytecode instructions to machine code.

**Pseudocode Currency Converter exercise**
```
Start
  A = the currency to be converted.
  B = the value in A of the currency to which A will be converted.

  C = A * B

  Return C
End
```
**Read about high and low level languages.**
